# Manim Radians Animation Library [deprecated]

Welcome to the repository for the very first video on the Project Carver Youtube channel. The code has since been deprecated and the video is no longer available. You can find the most up to date content for learning Radians at

## Description

This video is the very first of (hopefully) many in a series on trigonometry. 

Prerequisites: It's not required but it does help if you're familiar with ratios, fractions, and algebra equations to understand all the concepts in this video.

0:00 - What is direction/rotation?
3:15 - Degrees
4:00 - Why 360?
4:38 - Radians
7:12 - Radians vs. Degrees
9:48 - Recap

## How It's Made:

Python, <a href="https://github.com/3b1b/manim">Manim Library</a>

This software was coded primarily by <a href="https://github.com/JeroSQ">JeroSQ</a> in Python using the Manim library with small aesthetic changes done by myself.

## Lessons Learned:

Teaching content requires a lot of iterating to make lessons concise and approachable. What can start out as a lengthy explanation or complex animation, oftentimes can be reduced down to something much shorter and simpler. For basic animations like those displayed on the Project Carver website, the difficulty of building and maintaining Manim code far outweighs the benefits of its flexibility. Manim will likely only be used in future animations if it cannot be first completed in an animation software suite.
