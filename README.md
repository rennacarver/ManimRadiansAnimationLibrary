## How It's Made:

Python, <a href="https://github.com/3b1b/manim">Manim Library</a>

This software was coded primarily by <a href="https://github.com/JeroSQ">JeroSQ</a> in Python using the Manim library with small aesthetic changes done by myself.

## Lessons Learned:

Teaching content requires a lot of iterating to make lessons concise and approachable. What can start out as a lengthy explanation or complex animation, oftentimes can be reduced down to something much shorter and simpler. For basic animations like those displayed on the Project Carver website, the difficulty of building and maintaining Manim code far outweighs the benefits of its flexibility. Manim will likely only be used in future animations if it cannot be first completed in an animation software suite.
